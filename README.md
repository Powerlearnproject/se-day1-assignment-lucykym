Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain highquality software systems.It involves software product design,development,testing, deployment and maintenance.
It enables the creation of software applications and systems that provide various aspects of modern life ie communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcares.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering. In the 1960s, the increasing complexity of software systems led to a crisis. Projects were over budget, behind schedule, and often didn't meet expectations. 
2.The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The 1980s saw the emergence of OOP as a dominant programming paradigm. It shifted the focus from procedures to objects, encapsulating data and behavior within self-contained units.
3. The Agile Manifesto and the Agile Revolution: In 2001, a group of software developers published the Agile Manifesto, which emphasized individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and responding to change over following a plan. Â  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.
Closure ensure you close the project

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall method has a fixed timeline , the idea with the waterfall is to start and finish a project with a mapped out timeline while the agile method is alot more flexible and accounts for expeirments  with different directions.
Waterfall method once the end goal has been established there is no client involvement but in agile method the client is involved in the project develpoment at every stage. waterfall method can be used in building a puzzle. an agile method can be used in a mobile app development as the app can change a few things in it as the development proceeds. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is the backbone of the team and the project responsible in creating and maintaing softwareb applications. the Software developer is responsible to write, test and debug the code and also incharge of other team members. 
A quality assurance engineer is responsible in ensuring the quality of the software product by developing test plans and reporting and tracking an issue wwithin the software product.
A  project manager is  the one who oversees the  entire software develpment process.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs are software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. They integrate multiple development tools into a single interface, which can significantly enhance productivity and streamline the coding process. example is visual studio
VCS are essential tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They track revisions, support collaboration, and maintain a history of changes, making them crucial for both individual developers and teams.example is git, subversion
 
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Keeping up with rapid technology changes and advancements. the strategy to overcome this is to continue learning and expirement new technologies and as weel be a team member to understand and give different approaches a chance.
2. Poor software quality and maintenance Inadequate testing practices can lead to unreliable software and unsatisfied users.Including unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing, can help identify and fix issues early in development.
3. Limited budget and resources this can be a major issue incase the developer and the client fail to reach to an agreement especially with the budget.  this can be reduced if the developer and the client agree on the right and enough budget and resources.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:focuses on individual components or units of code ie functions methods etc . it is imprtant for early detection of defects, improving code quality, and increasing code maintainance
Integration Testing:Focuses on the nteractions between different software components or modules. it is important in identifying interface defects, ensuring data integrity, and verifying system behaviour.
System Testing: focuses  on the entire system as a complete product. it is important in assessing system performance, usability, reliability, and security.
Acceptance: focuses on ensuring software's ability to meet the needs of end-users. it is important in ensuring user satisfaction, gaining customer acceptance, and reducing the risk of post-release defects.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt : write something about doors.This prompt is vague because it doesn't specify what kind of information is required in concern to doors.
Improved prompt: write something about metallic doors around the mall;
